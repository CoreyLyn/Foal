# Foal

Foal is a Windows-native cleanup CLI context focused on preview-first cleanup, explicit execution, and conservative defaults.

## Language

**Mole-inspired report**:
A human-readable Foal report that borrows Mole's grouped preview style while preserving Foal's Windows-native safety model and conservative default cleanup boundary.
_Avoid_: Mole for Windows, feature parity, default rule expansion

**Default candidates**:
Cleanup items that Foal may preview by default and may later execute through the Recycle Bin after explicit confirmation.
_Avoid_: aggressive defaults, hidden cleanup

**Skipped by default**:
Recognized cleanup opportunities that Foal may report with size, count, status, or review commands, but does not include in default execution.
_Avoid_: default-enabled cache rules

**Review clues**:
Read-only cleanup hints that Foal surfaces for manual investigation without treating them as cleanup candidates.
_Avoid_: cleanup candidates, executable actions

**Human report labels**:
Plain ASCII presentation-only labels used in non-JSON output to make preview state, skipped state, clean state, clues, and review suggestions easier to scan.
_Avoid_: Unicode symbols, JSON status codes, execution semantics

**Permission boundary notice**:
A human-readable notice that explains protected or administrator-only locations were skipped without recommending elevation as the normal path.
_Avoid_: full preview prompt, automatic elevation, run as administrator recommendation

**Protection rules**:
Foal's active cleanup safety boundaries, including default Windows path-safety rules and any future user-defined protection entries.
_Avoid_: whitelist, allowlist-only model

**Detailed candidate list**:
A human-readable companion file for clean preview reports that records candidates, skipped items, review clues, and reasons without authorizing later execution.
_Avoid_: execution manifest, deletion input

**Review suggestions**:
Human-readable commands or next steps for external tools or manual investigation that Foal displays without executing or counting as Foal cleanup actions.
_Avoid_: cleanup actions, delegated execution

**Potential space**:
The bytes represented by Foal default candidates in a clean preview, excluding skipped-by-default items, review clues, external tool suggestions, and permission-boundary skips.
_Avoid_: total hinted space, external savings estimate

**Project artifact clue**:
A review clue for rebuildable project directories or build outputs that Foal may surface only through explicit analysis or future opt-in flows.
_Avoid_: default project scan, default clean candidate

**Running application skip**:
A skipped-by-default report state for cleanup opportunities tied to currently running applications or services, especially sync clients, browsers, IDEs, AI tools, containers, and virtualization tools.
_Avoid_: close-and-clean prompt, default candidate

**Clean preview read model**:
A shared representation of clean preview sections, candidates, skipped-by-default items, review clues, suggestions, protection rules, notices, totals, and detailed-list metadata for JSON, human output, and future TUI consumers.
_Avoid_: CLI string builder as model, TUI-owned cleanup model

**Uninstall preview report**:
A human-readable presentation surface rendered directly over the uninstall preview read model, mirroring the Mole-inspired report style while keeping uninstall preview-only and read-only.
_Avoid_: uninstall execution plan, uninstall manifest, leftover deletion list

**Not-inspected state**:
A report state asserting that Foal did not examine a discovery category at all, kept distinct from an inspected-but-empty result so the report never implies an examination that did not happen.
_Avoid_: none found, no leftovers, empty result
